abstract="Concolic testing is widely regarded as the state-of-the-art technique in dynamic discovering and analyzing trigger-based behavior in software programs. It uses symbolic execution and an automatic theorem prover to generate new concrete test cases to maximize code coverage for scenarios like software verification and malware analysis. While malicious developers usually try their best to hide malicious executions, there are also circumstances in which legitimate reasons are presented for a program to conceal trigger-based conditions and the corresponding behavior, which leads to the demand of control flow obfuscation techniques. We propose a novel control flow obfuscation design based on the incomprehensibility of artificial neural networks to fight against reverse engineering tools including concolic testing. By training neural networks to simulate conditional behaviors of a program, we manage to precisely replace essential points of a program's control flow with neural network computations. Evaluations show that since the complexity of extracting rules from trained neural networks easily goes beyond the capability of program analysis tools, it is infeasible to apply concolic testing on code obfuscated with our method. Our method also incorporates only basic integer operations and simple loops, thus can be hard to be distinguished from regular programs.",

    Regular-expression derivatives are an old, but elegant, technique for compiling regular
    expressions to deterministic Þnite-state machines.
    It easily supports extending the regular-expression operators with boolean operations,
    such as intersection and complement.
    Unfortunately, this technique has been lost in the sands of time and few computer
    scientists are aware of it. 
    In this paper, we reexamine regular-expression derivatives and report on our experiences in 
    the context of two different functional-language implementations.
    The basic implementation is simple and we show how to extend it to handle large character
    sets (e.g., Unicode).
    We also show that the derivatives approach leads to smaller state machines than the
    traditional algorithm given by McNaughton and Yamada.

abstract = {{
When constructing programs to process XML documents, we immediately face
the question as to how XML documents should be represented internally in
the programming language we use.  Currently, most representations for XML
documents are typeless in the sense that the type information of an XML
document cannot be reflected in the type of the representation of the
document (if the representation is assumed to be typed). Though convenient
to construct, a typeless representation for XML documents often makes use
of a large number of representation tags, which not only require some
significant amount of space to store but may also incur numerous run-time
tag checks when the represented documents are processed. Moreover, with a
typeless representation for XML documents, it becomes difficult or even
impossible to statically capture program invariants that are related to the
type information of XML documents. Building upon our recent work on guarded
recursive datatypes, we present an approach to representing XML documents
in this paper that not only allows the type information of an XML document
to be reflected in the type of the representation of the document but also
significantly reduces the need for representation tags that are required in
typeless representations.  With this approach, we become able to process
XML documents in a typeful manner, thus reaping various well-known software
engineering benefits from the presence of types.

  abstract = {We present some novel applications of our generic CHR-based
  type system framework for Hindley/Milner style systems
  such as checking for consistency of programs
  involving physical units, various overloading systems and
  enforcing certain security policies.
  Individual instances of our type system framework can be obtained by providing an appropriate
  domain of types  and constraints. The novelty of our approach is that properties of
  constraints can be described
  by Constraint Handling Rules (CHRs). As we will show, this makes it easy to design
  new type systems in a concise way.

  On the practical side, we have implemented the CHR-based type inference algorithm
  in the functional language Haskell including a simple user interface.
  This shows that our approach is not only of theoretical interest, but also represents an important
  tool for the designer of Hindley/Milner style type systems.},

              as opposed to the standard substitution-based formulation.
              This allows us to make important distinctions between different phases of type inference:
              Constraint generation/propagation, constraint solving, constraint simplification
              and term reconstruction.
              The inference system is parametric in the constraint domain, covering a wide range of
              application domains.
              A problem, incompleteness of substitution-based inference, identified by A.~J.~Kennedy
              can be solved naturally by employing a constraint-based view of type inference.
              In addition, our formulation of type inference can easily be tailored to
              different inference algorithms such as W and M.
              On the technical side, we present concise soundness and completeness results.},

    Type classes are an elegant extension to traditional, Hindley-Milner based typing systems.
    Various forms of type classes have been proposed in the literature, including single--parameter,
    multi--parameter, constructor classes and functional dependencies. Each new form of type class
    requires two essential properties, decidable type inference and unambiguity of programs,
    to be re-established. We introduce a general framework for type class systems based on
    Constraint Handling Rules (CHRs). This framework is powerful enough to express a wide range of
    type classes, and suggests new forms. Under sufficient conditions on the set of CHRs,
    we have decidable operational checks which enable type inference and ambiguity
    checking for type class systems.

We present a generic type inference algorithm for Hindley/Milner style  systems based on Constraint Handling Rules
 (CHRs). We are able to model Haskell-style type classes, records in style of Ohori and overloading in style of
System O and System CT. Inference algorithms for each of the above systems can be derived by providing the
appropriate CHRs and primitive functions. In previous work, we have introduced a general type class framework on
 CHRs. There, we focussed on the study of theoretical properties. We could establish sufficient conditions on
the set of CHRs under which we obtain decidable type inference. In this work we provide some pratical evidence of
our approach. We have actually implemented the CHR-based type inference algorithm (in Haskell) including a simple
user interface which allows to design your own type system. We give an overview of the
expressiveness of our system by example. }

  ABSTRACT = {The Java JDK 1.2 Security Architecture includes a dynamic mechanism for
                  enforcing access control checks, so-called \emph{stack inspection}. This paper
                  studies type systems which can statically guarantee the success of these
                  checks.  We develop these systems using a new, systematic methodology: we show
                  that the security-passing style translation, proposed by Wallach and Felten as
                  a \emph{dynamic} implementation technique, also gives rise to \emph{static}
                  security-aware type systems, by composition with conventional type systems.
                  To define the latter, we use the general HM(X) framework, and easily construct
                  several constraint- and unification-based type systems. They offer significant
                  improvements on a previous type system for JDK access control, both in terms
                  of expressiveness and in terms of readability of type specifications.}

                  over data types has been achieved with
                  polymorphism. Genericity over type constructors,
                  often called polytypism, is an area of active
                  research. This paper proposes that another kind of
                  genericity is needed: genericity over the length of
                  tuples. Untyped languages allow for such genericity
                  but typed languages do not (except for languages
                  allowing dependent types). The contribution of this
                  paper is to present the ``zip calculus,'' a typed
                  lambda calculus that provides genericity over the
                  length of tuples and yet does not require the full
                  generality of dependent types.",

abstract = {
Functional and logic programming are the most important declarative
programming paradigms, and interest in combining them has grown over
the last decade. Early research concentrated on the definition and
improvement of execution principles for such integrated languages,
while more recently efficient implementations of these execution
principles have been developed so that these languages became relevant
for practical applications. In this paper we survey the development of
the operational semantics as well as the improvement of the
implementation of functional logic languages.
